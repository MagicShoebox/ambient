A plugin for IntelliJ that enables assignment import and submission

Written with Kotlin, designed with Java + IntelliJ Form Designer. Build orchestrated by Gradle.

To start helping with the plugin, just start editing the source files.

The plugin will automatically be published upon merge to `master` by Travis.
